# Insertion Sort

## Explanation
Insertion Sort takes as a parameter an array $A[0...(n - 1)]$ containing a
sequence of length n that is to be sorted.  The algorithm sorts the input
number *in place*: it rearranges the numbers within the array $A$, with at
most a constant number of them stored outside the array at any time.  The
input array $A$ contains the sorted output sequence when the 
`insertion_sort` or `insertion_sort_recursive` procedures are finished.
