# Bubble Sort

# Explanation

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping
adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. It is named "bubble" sort
because the algorithm causes smaller elements to "bubble" to the top of the
list or array being sorted.

The basic idea of the algorithm is to make multiple passes over the array,
comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.
Each pass through the array will "bubble" the largest remaining element to its
correct position at the end of the array.
